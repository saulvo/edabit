/**
 * Traditional safes use a three-wheel locking mechanism, with the safe combination entered using a dial on the door of the safe.
 * The dial is marked with clockwise increments between 0 and 99. The three-number combination is entered by first dialling to the right (clockwise),
 * then to the left (anti-clockwise), and then to the right (clockwise) again. Combination numbers are read from the top of the dial:
 * Given the starting (top) position of the dial and the increments used for each turn of the dial,
 * return an array containing the combination of the safe.
